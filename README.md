## About The Project
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data
The purpose of this project using the above dataset from kaggle, was meant to create a machine learning model to predict which passengers survived the shipwreck. The project is also filled with other subjects such as EDA, feature engineering, and data wrangling. Multiple machine learning models were used with the best performing being logistic regression, which had a score of 81%. As I grow my skills as a data analyst I plan on periodically coming back to try new models/parameter tuning to increase the score further.
