## About The Project
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data

This project uses a Kaggle dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts which passengers survived the shipwreck. Along the way, I explored key data analysis concepts such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and data wrangling. Multiple machine learning models were tested, with logistic regression achieving the highest accuracy at 81%. As I continue to develop my skills in data analytics, I plan to revisit this project to experiment with new models and fine-tune parameters to further improve performance.
